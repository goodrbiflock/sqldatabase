						<p><span>The schema is where you can find relevant information about specifc dim and fact tables
								and their
								fields. This is where you will find variable types, short summaries and variable names.
								More in depth ones will be
								in each relevant page, this is just a specific line by line variable definition area.
								Basically, this is where all Data Warehouse specific information
								will live, where all the weeds can be explored.

						<h1>Dashboards</h1>
						<p><span>This is where the documnetation for specific dashboards will live once we have them
								built out in 2024, as of
								right now it houses out of date, very rough information about our time in Mode with
								Glew. Ideally this will house all the user information anyone would ever need to have a
								detailed use case for their dashboards.
